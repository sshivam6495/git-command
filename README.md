## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Always pull before pushing to avoid conflicts.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Don‚Äôt push directly to `main` or `develop`; use feature branches.
- Regularly pull from `main` to keep your branch updated.
- compare the push request and add meaningfull comment
- Before commit to github check the branch it should not be main
- eg order_tracking_system <- shivam_change
- Not main <- shivam_change
- Neverever merge the code.
